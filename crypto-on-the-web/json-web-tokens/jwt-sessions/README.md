### Analysis
This challenge is teaching us about JWT tokens and how they are used in web applications. The only thing needed here is to open a web application which uses JWT tokens and take a look at the request headers.

### Solution
The solution is the HTTP header name that includes the JWT token. Every programmer knowadays knows that this HTTP header is (mostly) in the format: `Authorization: Bearer JWT-TOKEN`.
