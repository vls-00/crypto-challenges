### Analysis
This challenge is an introduction on how to run python scriptsand gives us a script that we have to run in order to get the flag.

The script initializes an array of integers which seem random at first but if they get XOR'ed with `0x32` which is the number 50 in decimal and then converted to ASCII characters, will give us the flag.

### Solution

Run the script given by the challenge.
