### Analysis
In this challenge we have to do a modular exponentiation calculation. The numbers are obviously so big that the PC cannot handle them so we have to find an efficient method of calculating such big numbers without directly calculating them. We can use the Right-to-left binary method for modular exponentiation which is a very efficient method. Details about the algorithm can be found in: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation`

### Solution
I created a python script based on the Bruce Schneier pseudocode found in `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation`
