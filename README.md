# Cryptography Challenges
⛓️‍💥🕵️ This repository includes my solutions of the challenges offered by `cryptohack.org`.

Each file includes a `README.md` with a solution analysis and the corresponding python script (if needed).

## Challenge Categories Included:
* Elliptic Curves
* Crypto On The Web
* Diffie-Hellman
* General
* Hash Functions
* Introduction
* Misc
* RSA
* Symmetric Ciphers

# ⚠️Disclaimer
* Give every challenge the appropriate research and time before seeing the solution.
* Each challenge is a small journey that will help you understand more about cryptography and the algorithms😎.
