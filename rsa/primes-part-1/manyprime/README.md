### Analysis
The challenge involves factoring a large RSA modulus for `n`. 

As the exercise states, the `ECM` (Elliptic Curve Method) algorithm, which uses elliptic curves, is highly effective for factoring numbers with multiple prime factors.

We can leverage the `ECM` module from sage to calculate these factors which takes about 2 minutes. After that we can calculate `phi` which is
`(factor1 - 1)(factor2 - 1)(factor3 - 1)....(factorM - 1)` and then the private key to decrypt the flag.

### Solution
1. Calculate the factors using the `ECM` module from sage.
2. Calculate `phi` as `phi(N) = (p1 - 1) * (p2 - 1) * (p3 - 1) .... * (pn - 1)`
3. Calculate the private key `d`
4. Decrypt the flag using `d`
