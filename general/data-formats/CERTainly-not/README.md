### Analysis
In this challenge we need to convert the `.der` to `.pem` format aand obtain the modulus from an RSA key.

In order to get the modulus from the key we can use the same logic as in `privacy-enhanced-mail` challenge.

For the conversions we can use the `pyopenssl` library.

### Solution

1. Use the OpenSSL library to convert the `.der` certificate to ASN1 format.
2. Use the OpenSSL library to convert the ASN1 certificate to `.pem` format.
3. Use the OpenSSL library to fetch the public key from the PEM certificate.
4. We use the same method as in `privacy-enhanced-mail` to dump the public key from the certificate.
5. Fetch the `n` field from the key which is the modulus and the flag.
