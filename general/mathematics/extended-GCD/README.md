### Analysis
For this challengewe will have to make a python script to find numbers u, v so that `a*u + b*v = gcd(a,b)` using the extended Euclid's algorithm.

Resource: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm`

### Solution
The python script provided is my implementation based on the pseudocode and the extended euclidean algorithm.

 More details can be foung in the resource above. The flag is the smaller of the 2 numbers as stated by the challenge.
