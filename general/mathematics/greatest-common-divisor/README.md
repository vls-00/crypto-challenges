### Analysis
For this challenge we have to make a python script to find the greatest common divisor between the numbers 66528 and 52920 using the Euclid's algorithm which is a very efficient method for findign the GCD.\
* The pseudocode can be found in: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm`

### Solution
Peudocode explained:
>In each iteration we replace the bigger number with the smaller one and the smaller one with the remainder of the two numbers division. When the remainder becomes 0 then the GCD is the small number of the two.

In the python script provided is my implementation of this algorithm.
